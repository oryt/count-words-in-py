# count-words-in-py
A small script I wrote for a Python course. You feed it a text file and it loops over the text and print out a list with the 100 most used words in the list. I am certain that there is a lot of things that could be improved with the code and that I have written stuff in a redundant way but it filled its purpose and if I have time some day I might come back to it but I doubt it because if I had time then I would most likely be coding on something else then this.
